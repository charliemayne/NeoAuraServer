run npm i from the command line to install all js dependencies

This is currently set up to connect to a local MySQL server instance so make sure your user/pass matches (/server/db/index.js)

I built this template around a database with one table with a name and message column. This template has routes to retrieve all names/messages in the table and to retireve messages based on a name

run npm run dev to start the server
